# NZB Streamer

Stream video files directly from Usenet NZBs without downloading the entire file first. Inspired by NZBDrive's virtual filesystem approach.

## Features

- üé¨ Stream video while downloading
- ‚è© Full seeking support  
- üì¶ RAR transparency (no extraction needed)
- üöÄ Minimal bandwidth usage
- üîß Future Stremio addon support

## How It Works

1. Upload an NZB file or provide one via API
2. The system parses RAR headers to find video files
3. Video files become immediately streamable via HTTP
4. Only downloads the parts needed for playback
5. Intelligent prefetching for smooth streaming

## Requirements

- Rust 1.75+
- Usenet account with provider
- NZBs with video in uncompressed RARs (store mode)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nzb-streamer
cd nzb-streamer

# Copy environment config
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Usenet credentials

# Build and run
cargo run

# Upload test NZB
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/test/upload \
  -F "nzb=@movie.nzb"

# Response includes streaming URL
# Open in VLC: http://localhost:3000/stream/{session_id}/movie.mp4
```
